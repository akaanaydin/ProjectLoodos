<h1 align=center>Arslan Kaan AYDIN  Loodos Case</h1> 

I model the data I got from a movie database site and transferred it to the application with Alamofire. I created a detail page for the movies and showed the pictures by downloading them with Kingfisher. I made the auto layout of the application programmatically with Snapkit. I hope you like.
